# Introduction

This project illustrates how to create a data analyst portfolio project with hotel booking data. It entails creating a database, data extraction and transformation with SQL, and visualization with Power BI to respond to important business questions.

# Project Overview

This project is intended to process and visualize hotel reservation data in order to get insights into revenue patterns, parking lot usage, and guest patterns. 

It involves the following key steps:

1.  **Database Development:** Creating a database by importing Excel files into Microsoft SQL Server Studio.
